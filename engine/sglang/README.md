# SGLang patches

Engine changes are kept as `git format-patch` files against the paper's SGLang pin,
`bd66ce343e4f6e2f2b75d7e820fe4d0718a8d824` (branch `verified-progress` in `~/sglang`).
Apply them in a private worktree, never in `~/sglang` itself:

```sh
scripts/sglang_worktree.sh <name>                      # creates ~/sglang-wt/<name>
git -C ~/sglang-wt/<name> am "$PWD"/engine/sglang/patches/<workstream>/<patch>.patch
SGLANG_WORKTREE=~/sglang-wt/<name> source scripts/sglang_env.sh
```

Patches live under `engine/sglang/patches/<workstream>/NNNN-<topic>.patch`, with one
section per workstream below.

## geometry

### geometry/0001-head-capture-replay-dumps.patch (capture only)

The geometry workstream's patch. It records the exact LM-head inputs for the real-head replay in
`experiments/head_geometry/`. It changes nothing unless `SGLANG_HEAD_CAPTURE_DIR` is set.
When it is set:

- `LogitsProcessor.forward` stashes `pruned_states`, the tensor it hands to the head,
  together with the forward mode (`srt/debug_utils/head_capture.py`).
- EAGLE/NEXTN (topk 1): `draft_forward` keeps the head input behind each draft token
  (the first comes from the previous draft extend, the rest from the stash), and after
  verification one `mtp_verify` record per step stores the draft and target head inputs,
  the verify tokens, the engine's target argmax, its top-2 logits and the accept lengths.
- DFlash: one `dflash_verify` record per step with the draft hidden states at block
  positions 1 to block size - 1 (the input to the draft's projection through the target
  head), the stashed target
  verify head input, the proposed block, the target argmax and accept lengths.
- Plain decode (no speculation): one `plain_decode` record per forward with the head
  input, the sampled token and the engine's top-2 logits.

Hidden vectors are stored as BF16 bit patterns, so the offline analysis sees the values
the head read. The hooks run in Python between forwards, so the server must run with
`--disable-cuda-graph --disable-overlap-schedule`; a record whose stashed tensor has the
wrong forward mode or row count is skipped with a warning rather than misaligned. The
patch adds device-to-host copies on every step and is for measurement only.
